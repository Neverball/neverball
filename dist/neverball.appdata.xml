  <summary>Deftly Guide a Rolling Ball through Many Slick 3D Levels</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Guide a rolling ball through dangerous territory that you control by
      tilting the floor. Balance on narrow bridges, navigate mazes, ride
      moving platforms, and dodge pushers and shovers to get to the goal.
      Race against the clock to collect coins to earn extra balls. With nice
      physics and very clean and appealing 3D graphics, this is definitely a
      must play.
