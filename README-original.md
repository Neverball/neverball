# Neverball

Tilt the  floor to roll a  ball through an obstacle  course within the
given  time.  If  the  ball falls  or time  expires, a ball is lost.

Collect coins to unlock the exit  and earn extra balls.  Red coins are
worth 5.  Blue coins are worth 10.  A ball is awarded for 100 coins.

## Translation

Neverball uses the gettext approach to translations. We're always
interested in covering more languages. We have a project on Transifex
(see [instructions on the forum][tx]) and we also accept PO files.
