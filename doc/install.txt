                            * Neverball *


* REQUIREMENTS

    SDL               http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
    SDL_ttf           http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
    PhysicsFS         http://icculus.org/physfs/
    libvorbis         http://xiph.org/vorbis/
    libpng            http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
    libjpeg           http://ijg.org/

To build Neverball with native language support on systems not using
the GNU C library, an additional library may have to be installed:

    libintl           http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

To build Neverball with Nintendo Wii Remote support on Linux, the
"official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack" or BlueZ and the libwiimote
library must be installed and configured:

    BlueZ             http://www.bluez.org/
    libwiimote        http://libwiimote.sourceforge.net/

To build Neverball with Hillcrest Labs Loop support enabled, the
libfreespace and libusb libraries must be installed and configured:

    libusb-1.0        http://libusb.org/wiki/Libusb1.0
    libfreespace      http://libfreespace.hillcrestlabs.com/

* FONTS

The Deja Vu font used by Neverball is not suitable for all
translations included with the game. Due to file size concerns,
another font is not included with Neverball; however, additional fonts
can be installed in these locations:

    ttf/wqy-zenhei.ttc    Simplified Chinese
    ttf/wqy-microhei.ttc  Traditional Chinese

The Wen Quan Yi Chinese fonts may be obtained from here:

* COMPILATION

Under Unix and Linux, simply run

    make

Certain features can be enabled/disabled at compile time by passing
additional arguments to Make in the form "NAME=VALUE", where NAME is
one of those listed below and VALUE is typically 0 for disabled, 1 for
enabled.

    ENABLE_NLS=1

        Enable native language support. May require additional
        libraries.

    ENABLE_TILT=wii

        Enable Wii Remote support. Requires additional libraries and
        system configuration.

    ENABLE_TILT=loop

        Enable Hillcrest Labs Loop support. Requires additional
        libraries and system configuration.

    ENABLE_FS=stdio

        Enable alternate file system backend that uses standard I/O
        instead of PhysicsFS (thus making the dependency optional),
        but does not provide archive support.

Under Mac OS X, build using the provided Xcode project files.

For Windows builds, the MinGW cross-compilation environment is
supported. (Native builds are theoretically possible using MinGW and
MSYS. Although care is taken to preserve compatibility with MSYS, no
support exists and no actual testing is done.)

By default, an uninstalled build may be executed in place.


* INSTALLATION

The game searches for game assets in the following three places, in
this order. If the game is to be installed globally, at least one of
them must be set.

 1. The directory specified as argument to '--data' (or '-d') option
    on the command line.

 2. The directory given by the NEVERBALL_DATA environment variable.

 3. The directory given by the CONFIG_DATA macro defined in
    share/base_config.h (which corresponds to the DATADIR Makefile
    variable).

A normal Linux installation would probably copy the data directory to
"/usr/local/share/games/neverball/" and set DATADIR to match.


* DISTRIBUTION

The dist subdirectory contains some miscellaneous files:

  * "Desktop entry" or .desktop files.
  * Icons in PNG, SVG and ICO formats.
